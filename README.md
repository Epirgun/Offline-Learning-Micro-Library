# Offline Learning Micro Library 📚

A lightweight, offline-first micro library platform built with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS.  
Created as part of a hackathon submission.

## 🚀 About the Project

### ✨ Inspiration
This project was inspired by the idea of making learning accessible even without internet access. I wanted to create a simple tool where people could browse learning resources offline, ensuring knowledge is always within reach.

### 🛠️ How I Built It
- **React** with **Vite** as the core framework for fast development and optimized builds.  
- **React Router** for navigating between different pages.  
- **TailwindCSS** for a clean, responsive UI.  
- Experimented with **Service Workers** to enable offline access.  

### 📚 What I Learned
- Setting up a React project with Vite.  
- How routing works with React Router.  
- Debugging and fixing JSON/package issues in `package.json`.  
- Deploying apps to GitHub Pages.  
- First steps in offline-first development with Service Workers.  

### ⚡ Challenges I Faced
- Understanding how React + Vite work together.  
- Struggling with routing and figuring out how pages connect.  
- Debugging `package.json` errors.  
- Implementing offline features with Service Workers (a big learning curve).  
- Having to figure out most things independently without prior experience.
